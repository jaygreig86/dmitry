Document Purpose
=========================================================================

This Document describes how-to build and install DMitry on a system.

=========================================================================
Typographical conventions
=========================================================================

Command lines written as

	# command

should be executed as the superuser.

Command lines written as

	% command

should be executed as an unpriveleged user.

=========================================================================
Build Requirements
=========================================================================

	o ANSI/ISO C89/C90 C compiler, e.g GNU gcc
	o ANSI C
	o Disk space: 638k to unpack, 928k to build, 57k to install

=========================================================================
Installing
=========================================================================
1. Configure DMitry
   Run ./configure from the top-level directory, this will configure
   DMitry for your operating system. See ./configure --help for any 
   user/system specific options you may wish to set.

	% ./configure

2. Compile DMitry
   Run 'make' from the top-level directory.  With some systems you may 
   need to use 'gmake' or even 'gnumake' instead of the default system
   make.

	% make

  The above procedure will suit an unpriveleged user to simply run
  the application from their home directory (See Running below).

3. Test DMitry
   To simply test that the software compiled correctly, the following
   command is used.

	% ./dmitry

   The program should then run and display available options.

4. Install DMitry
   If you are a system administrator and wish to allow yourself and 
   unpriveleged users to use DMitry, then the following instructions
   can be used to achieve this.

   Run 'make install' from the top-level directory.  This will install the binary
   'dmitry' into /usr/local/bin/.

	# make install

=========================================================================
Running
=========================================================================

If you followed steps 1 through 3 DMitry is assumed to be installed
in /usr/local/bin.  The client can now be run from the command line
simply by using the command dmitry.

	# dmitry

To run dmitry with any available options simply specify them along with
the target domain you wish to gather relational information for, i.e.

	# dmitry -iwnso somedomain.net

This will display information related to the domain "somedomain.net"
outputting the information to stdout and also save the output to a text
file named "somedomain.net.txt".

Troubleshooting & Suggestions
=========================================================================

Currently there is no FAQ for the program, however, if you have any
suggestions or require any technical help or find a bug, please email me
